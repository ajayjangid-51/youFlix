Video sharing platform

I developed a video sharing web application similar to YouTube using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js). The application allows users to upload, watch, and share videos, as well as create and manage their own channels.

The application features a user-friendly interface that allows users to search and browse videos, and leave comments. I implemented server-side rendering with Express.js to improve the performance and SEO of the website.

I used MongoDB to store the video link and user data, and used Mongoose for data modeling and validation.

I integrated Google Firebase Storage for video hosting and used Redux for managing the application's state. Additionally, I implemented a search feature and filtering options to help users quickly find the videos they are looking for.

The application was designed to be responsive and mobile-friendly, making it easy for users to watch and share videos on any device. The goal of this project was to create a safe&secure, powerful and easy-to-use video sharing platform that can be used for personal and professional use.
